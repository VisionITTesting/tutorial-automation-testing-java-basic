####  What is Artifact ID, Group ID and Version and what is the use?
* GroupID + Artifact ID + version = Gives your project a uniq identity
* Also called as signature of the your project
* Group ID usually refers to your company and sub divisions
* Artifact ID refers to your project name
* For example, if you are working for a company lets say "infosys" and lets say you are working in a department whose name is "Center of Excellence or CoE". And assume your are automating an ecommerce application. Then group id and artifact id can be as below:
    * Group ID: ```com.infosys.coe```
    * Artifact ID: ```ECommerceAutomationTestFW```
    * Version: ```3.1.3```
* Full signature of the project on "maven repo" will be: ```com.infosys.coe.ECommerceAutomationTestFW:3.1.3```
* You will then upload your project artifacts and compiled code on online maven repository ![ClickHere](https://mvnrepository.com/)
* This is important when some one else wants make use of your project. 
* They can simply refer to your project from online maven repository.
* This is how we use Selenium, Junit, TestNG, Cucumber libraries in our project.
